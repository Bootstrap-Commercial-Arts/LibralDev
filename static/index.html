          <p>LibRAL Arts is an online environment intended to be a familiar space to come in and spend some time.  We are marketers by day, on a mission to use our powers for good–exposing manipulative tactics that have been hijacked from our industry and misused for political gain. The habit today is to skim through sites, only glancing at content before moving on when our goldfish-sized attention spans expire. On this site, content is formatted for leisurely browsing to encourage a different speed of information ingestion–one that encourages meaningful thought.</p>
          <p class="bold-italic">Welcome to LibRAl Arts: an escape from the internet without leaving the comfort of the internet.</p>
