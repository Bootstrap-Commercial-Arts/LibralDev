                        <span>These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in
                            respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and
                            us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not
                            operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest
                            extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
                            at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure
                            to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
                            provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not
                            affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
                            venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
                            result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will
                            not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all
                            defenses you may have based on the
                            electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
                            execute these Legal Terms.</span></div>
